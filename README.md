**[ABSTRACT]**
Hypoxia-induced Pulmonary Hypertension (HPH) is a lethal cardiovascular disease characterized by an elevation in pulmonary artery pressure, which lead to right ventricular dysfunction and eventual heart failure. Further exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of HPH is still urgent. Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) are emerging as potential regulators of cellular responses to hypoxia. Profiling sncRNAs expression changes under hypoxic conditions may reveal the pathogenesis and mechanisms of HPH development and suggest possible therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, studies on the expression of sncRNAs in HPH model are still limited. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sncRNA profiles in eight different tissues of adult male HPH rats using high-throughput sequencing. Our study identified several novel sncRNAs, with the brain, kidney, and spleen exhibiting the largest number of microRNA (miRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tDR) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) respectively. Moreover, this study found multiple tissue-specific and hypoxia-responsive sncRNAs especially miRNAs and tDRs. Arm switching was observed for several miRNAs under hypoxia, and the proportion of 5’ tRNA-halves among total tDRs was found to significantly increase under hypoxia. Overall, our study generated a comprehensive characterization of the sncRNA profiles in HPH rats, and offering potential implications for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HPH and hypoxia-associated diseases.
